##PROJECT EULER GO ANSWERS

_"Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming
problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve.
Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods,
the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most
problems."_ in [https://projecteuler.net](https://projecteuler.net/about)

This is my approach and my understanding on solving those challenges
using [GO](https://golang.org/)

Each problem will be separated by folder.
